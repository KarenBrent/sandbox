## Markdown - basic syntax
(I'll use the format: heading / Markdown syntax / how this is then rendered)


#### Headings
```
# heading 1 (largest)
## heading 2
### heading 3
#### heading 4
##### heading 5
###### heading 6 (smallest)
```
# heading 1 (largest)
## heading 2
### heading 3
#### heading 4
##### heading 5
###### heading 6 (smallest)


#### Paragraphs / line breaks
```
Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

Like this.

Two spaces at the end of a line - like here:  
result in a line break.

#### Links
```

Here is a [link](http://bbc.co.uk/news) to the BBC News web site.

For relative links (i.e. to other files in your GitHub repo) you can use the following shorthand:
Instead of using the standard absolute link syntax, for example:
```
[a link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)
```
you can use the following relative link syntax:
```
[a link](other_file.md)
```
and GitHub will ensure the link resolves to `user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md`.

#### Code blocks
```
Surround the contents of the code block with 3 back ticks (i.e. 3x` at the beginning and end)
to create a code block
Blah, blah, blah
etc.
```


#### Code phrase
```
Surround the code phrase in back ticks (e.g. `i_love_cake`)
```
Enter `i_love_cake` into the command line.
