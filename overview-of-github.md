## Some key GitHub terms

_branch_
- Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub Flow is based upon it. 
- There is always one "master" branch and then zero or more other branches. 
- The master should always be viewed as, well, the master! Anything in the master branch is always deployable.

_commit_
- Each commit is considered a separate unit of change and full history is persisted.
- Commit messages are important, especially since Git tracks your changes and then displays them as commits once they're pushed to the server. By writing clear commit messages, you can make it easier for other people to follow along and provide feedback.

_pull request_
- This is how people contribute their changes back to the master (or to another specified branch). 
- When a pull request is received, the owner can review the changes, provide feedback comments, etc. and decide to merge in the changes, if desired.

_merge_
- The process of taking submitted changes from other branches and contributing them into the master branch.
